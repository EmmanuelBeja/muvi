# ADR-001: Use Vite for Bundling and Dev Server

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We needed a modern, fast, and lean bundler for a React + TypeScript application. Options included:

- Webpack
- CRA
- Parcel
- Vite

## Decision

We chose **Vite**.

## Consequences

- Faster development experience with hot-module replacement (HMR)
- Optimized build output using Rollup under the hood
- Built-in support for TypeScript and JSX without extra config
- Ecosystem growing rapidly; well-maintained and battle-tested

## Disadvantage

- Some advanced Webpack-only plugins/tools arenâ€™t directly compatible
