ADR-001: Use Vite for Bundling and Dev Server

Status: Accepted
Context: We needed a modern, fast, and lean bundler for a React + TypeScript application. Options included Webpack, CRA, Parcel, and Vite.
Decision: We chose Vite.
Consequences:

- Faster development experience with hot-module replacement (HMR).

- Optimized build output using Rollup under the hood.

- Built-in support for TypeScript and JSX without extra config.

- Ecosystem growing rapidly; well-maintained and battle-tested.

- Some advanced Webpack-only plugins/tools arenâ€™t directly compatible.
