# ADR-002: Use TypeScript over JavaScript

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We needed type safety, scalability, and maintainability for a growing codebase.

## Decision

We chose **TypeScript**.

## Consequences

- Strong typing reduces runtime bugs
- Better developer experience via IntelliSense and refactoring
- Easier onboarding and collaboration

## Disadvantage

- Extra learning curve for juniors not used to strict typing
