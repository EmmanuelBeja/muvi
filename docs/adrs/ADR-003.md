ADR-003: Use TailwindCSS for Styling

Status: Accepted
Context: Styling options included CSS Modules, SCSS, Styled Components, Emotion, and TailwindCSS.
Decision: We chose TailwindCSS.
Consequences:

- Utility-first approach speeds up development.

- Consistent design system without custom CSS sprawl.

- Dead-code elimination keeps bundle sizes small (Purging unused classes).

- Strong ecosystem (plugins, typography, forms, animations).

- Can lead to “class soup” if not structured well.
