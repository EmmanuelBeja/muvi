# ADR-004: Use shadcn/ui for Component Library

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We considered:

- Material UI
- Chakra UI
- Radix
- shadcn/ui

## Decision

We chose **shadcn/ui**.

## Consequences

- Built on top of Radix primitives — accessibility-first
- TailwindCSS-compatible — consistent styling with our system
- Copy-paste model — full control and no dependency lock-in

## Disadvantage

- Slightly more setup effort compared to plug-and-play libraries like MUI
