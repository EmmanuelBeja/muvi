ADR-005: Use Zustand for State Management

Status: Accepted
Context: Options included Redux, Recoil, MobX, Jotai, and Zustand.
Decision: We chose Zustand.
Consequences:

- Lightweight, minimal boilerplate compared to Redux.

- Excellent performance (state slices, shallow compare).

- Simple API → create() stores are easy to reason about.

- Doesn’t provide strict architectural patterns like Redux Toolkit.
