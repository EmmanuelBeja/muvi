# ADR-005: Use Zustand for State Management

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Options included:

- Redux
- Recoil
- MobX
- Jotai
- Zustand

## Decision

We chose **Zustand**.

## Consequences

- Lightweight, minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Excellent performance (state slices, shallow compare)
- Simple API — create() stores are easy to reason about

## Disadvantage

- Doesn’t provide strict architectural patterns like Redux Toolkit
