ADR-006: Use TanStack React Router for Routing

Status: Accepted
Context: Options included React Router DOM, Next.js routing, and TanStack Router.
Decision: We chose TanStack React Router.
Consequences:

- Type-safe routes â†’ strong TypeScript integration.

- Nested layouts and data loading built-in.

- Better alignment with React Query (same TanStack family).

- Newer and less widely adopted than React Router DOM.
