# ADR-006: Use TanStack React Router for Routing

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Options included:

- React Router DOM
- Next.js routing
- TanStack Router

## Decision

We chose **TanStack React Router**.

## Consequences

- Type-safe routes â€” strong TypeScript integration
- Nested layouts and data loading built-in
- Better alignment with React Query (same TanStack family)

## Disadvantage

- Newer and less widely adopted than React Router DOM
