# ADR-007: Use TanStack React Query for Data Fetching

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Alternatives included:

- SWR
- Apollo Client
- Redux Toolkit Query

## Decision

We chose **TanStack React Query**.

## Consequences

- Automatic caching, revalidation, retries — handles async complexity
- Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux or raw fetch/axios
- DevTools for debugging queries and mutations

## Disadvantage

- Doesn’t handle GraphQL as natively as Apollo Client
