ADR-007: Use TanStack React Query for Data Fetching

Status: Accepted
Context: Alternatives included SWR, Apollo Client, and Redux Toolkit Query.
Decision: We chose TanStack React Query.
Consequences:

- Automatic caching, revalidation, retries → handles async complexity.

- Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux or raw fetch/axios.

- DevTools for debugging queries and mutations.

- Doesn’t handle GraphQL as natively as Apollo Client.
