# ADR-008: Use Cypress for End-to-End Testing

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We needed a reliable testing framework for E2E, integration, and some component-level tests. Options included:

- Jest (unit focus)
- Playwright
- Cypress

## Decision

We chose **Cypress**.

## Consequences

- Runs tests directly in the browser â€” realistic simulation of user interactions
- Time-travel debugging and screenshots/videos built-in
- Strong ecosystem of plugins and CI/CD integrations
- Developer-friendly DX (clear errors, live reload test runner)

## Disadvantage

- Slightly slower for very large test suites compared to Playwright
- Not as lightweight as Jest for pure unit testing (but focus here is E2E)
